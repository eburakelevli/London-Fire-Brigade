Determine Data Mining Goals
This project aims to help LFBâ€™s safety goal by understanding and analysing the historical data, learning from it and make suggestions accordingly. The study focuses on reducing the loss of life and property by serving faster, reducing the

cost to serve better, and increasing the preparedness of LFB by answering the following:
Business Questions:

notional cost?
2. Whataretheeffectsofdifferentincidentgroupsonthenotionalcost?
3. PredictionofIncidentgroupforfalsealarmtoavoiddeployingpumps

5. Occurrenceofmultiplefiresinthesamebuildingorareaovertime.
6. Numberofpumpsrequiredforanincidentreportedbasedonseverityof

Data Mining Tasks:
1. Incident group prediction by a prediction algorithm,
2. Incident group and property category affecting notional cost by a
descriptive algorithm,
3. Area wise clustering of incident using clustering algorithm as descriptive
model
4. Identify patterns and anomalies in fire incident data with respect to
recurring incidents.
5. Prediction of Pump count using predictive algorithm
