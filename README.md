# London Fire Brigade - Data Mining Project
Business Improvement and Solutions

● Detected that false alarm is +20% costly compare to other components of LFB through Python and Tableau
● Applied algorithms to pinpoint key false alarm parameters, improving detection accuracy
● Enhanced LFB's efficiency by 33.4% through proactive false alarm predictione algorithm

Data Mining Tasks:
1. Incident group prediction by a prediction algorithm,
2. Incident group and property category affecting notional cost by a
descriptive algorithm,
3. Area wise clustering of incident using clustering algorithm as descriptive
model
4. Identify patterns and anomalies in fire incident data with respect to
recurring incidents.
5. Prediction of Pump count using predictive algorithm
